### Write an algorithm for accepting two numbers, divide the first number by second and display their quotient.

```
Step1 Start algorithm
step2 Accept first number
step3 Accept second number
step4 Then divide the first number by second
step5 Store it in the result
step6 Display the quotient
step7 End the algorithm
```
### Write an algorithm for accepting distance in kilometers, convert it into meters and display the result.
```
Step1 Start algorithm
Step2 Accept the distance in kilometers
step3 meters=kilometers*1000
step4 display in meters
step5 End the Algorithm
```
### Write an algorithm for accepting five numbers and display the sum and average of the numbers.
```
Step1 Start Algorithm
Step2 Accept Five numbers a,b,c,d,e
step3 take S and average to store he sum and average
step4 S= a=b+c+d+e
step5 average= S/5
step6 End the Algorithm
```
### Write an algorithm for accepting a number and display the whether it is odd or even.
```
Step1 Start Algorithm
Step2 Accept a number
Step3 Divide the the number by 2 and put it equals to zero
Step4 If the remainder is 0 then display even else odd
Step5 End the Algorithm
```
### Write an algorithm for accepting two numbers and display the highest number among two.
```
Step1 Start Algorithm
Step2 Accept Two Numbers a and b
Step3 If a>b then display a is largest
      otherwise
       display b is largest
Step4 End the Algorithm
```
### Write an algorithm for calculating the area of rectangle and square separately
```
Step1 Start Algorithm
Step2 Accept the length and breadth of a rectangle
Step3 Accept the side of a square a
Step4 then calculate area_rect=length*breadth
Step5 and also calcuate area_square=4*a
step6 display both of them
step7 End the Algorithm
```
### Write an algorithm for accepting the distance and speed values for a particular journey, calculate the time taken for the journey and display the same.
```
Step1 Start Algorithm
Step2 Accept the distance in km and speed in km/hr
Step3 calculate time= distance/speed
Step4 Display the time
step5 End the Algorithm
```
### Write an algorithm for accepting third character of the given string and then display whether it is vowel or constant.
```
Step1 Start Algorithm
Step2 take the length of the string
step3 check the character from the length and see whether it is equal to a,e,i,o,u. check in both upper case and lower case
Step4 if it is equal then display character is vowel otherwise it is consonant
Step5 End the Algorithm
